### what i learnt

- Spring Boot Starter Parent -> we can know spring boot dependencies versions,java version,different plugins & all the default configuration.
- Spring Boot Starter Web  -> all the dependencies we can get from spring boot starter web
- Embedded Tomcat -> by using spring boot starter web we can get tomcat files, Tomcat can be run in embedded mode;
  it means that it is not necessary to build a WAR file and deploy it in a standalone Tomcat server.
- Dev Tools ->automatically reload application
